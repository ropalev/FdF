# FDF
## Project objective
 Learn basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint
## Skills to acquire and use
•	Fundamentals of C  
•	Algorithm elaboration   
•	Imperative programming   
•	Rigor   
•	Graphics  
## How to run it? (works on Linux)
•	git clone https://github.com/ropalev/FdF.git «Folder name»  
•	cd «Folder name»  
•	make  
•	run the program using executable "fdf" and a map model text file as an argument. 
For example:  
```
./fdf map_name
```
## What does it do?
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe”  representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments.

The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program:
